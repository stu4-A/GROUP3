Render.com Server Free version uses low computing power so when uploading marks doesnt work so the solution is it use the ip address the Machine that the Django project backend api 
Use ipconfig to get the ip address the place it in the Axios Instance where the render url is supposed to be placed
Run the Django project backend using python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 to expose it to the internet
